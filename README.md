-----Brief Description-----
- The goal of the app is to motivate users to workout by logging daily workouts,
  saving workout history, and providing motivational quotes with a streak section
- For the front end, we used ReactNative, TypeScript, and Expo Go/Expo CLI for runtime
- For the back end, we used (mainly) JavaScript and TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, and Port 4000
- Our target users are people who are beginners/intermediates to the gym since the app provides motivation to
  go consistently, an array of workouts to try, and sets the gym as a daily practice
